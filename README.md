# JS_HTML_regex_tag_attribute_manipulation
Manipulate HTML tags and attributes using plain JS and RegEx.

This demonstrates how to maniupulate front-end HTML in an unideal situation where you have limited access and flexibility to modify HTML structure. Assuming we don't have classes or IDs to target the HTML tags, we try to find a pattern that we can use, and write a script that identifies the tags so we can target them.
